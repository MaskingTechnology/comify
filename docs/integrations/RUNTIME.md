The runtime integration provides a universal interaction layer with Jitar and the configuration for for setting up the other integrations.

## Errors

Both the domain and web UI containers do not depend on Jitar to operate. However, there are certain aspects of Jitar that we want to utilize for better debuggabilityâ€”specifically, its error handling.

Jitar automatically creates API endpoints based on the segment configuration. By default, it translates every application error into an Internal Server Error, which is transported with a 500 status code over HTTP. To help Jitar translate application errors into more meaningful status codes, we can leverage its error-handling mechanisms.

To decouple these errors from the domain, a separate set of errors has been added to this integration, which are used by the domain. Each error is an extension of a Jitar error:

* **BadRequest** - status code 400
* **Unauthorized** - status code 401
* **NotFound** - status code 404
* **ValidationError** - status code 400 (specialization of NotFound)
* **ServerError** - status code 500

If we decide to migrate from Jitar to another solution, these errors will need to be remapped.

## Health checks

Jitar provides a [health check](https://docs.jitar.dev/deploy/health-checks.html) system for monitoring the health of worker nodes. We leverage this system to check the availability of the services behind the integrations:

* Database
* File store
* Notification

For each health check, we implemented Jitar's interface. These implementations are located in the `healthchecks` folder. An instance is created and provided to Jitar from the similarly named health check file in the runtime root folder.

## Middleware

Jitar provides a [middleware](https://docs.jitar.dev/develop/middleware.html) system for intercepting RPC requests. We leverage this system for authentication. For this we've created two types of middleware:

* Authentication - server side middleware hooked to the authentication integration
* Requester - client side middleware for browser control

For each middleware, we implemented Jitar's interface. These implementations are located in the `middleswares` folder. An instance is created and provided to Jitar from the similarly named middleware file in the runtime root folder.

## Set up and tear down

Jitar provides a [set-up and tear-down](https://docs.jitar.dev/develop/setup-and-teardown.html) system for executing tasks before starting and stopping a service. We leverage this system for connection / disconnecting the services behind the integrations. We have script for the following two Jitar services:

* Gateway (authentication)
* Node (database, event broker, file store, notification)

For each service, we implemented a separate set-up and tear-down script in the runtime root folder.

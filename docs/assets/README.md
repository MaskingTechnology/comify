# Assets | Comify docs

The assets container contains all kind of non-code related things that can be use by the [Web UI](../webui/) and / or the [Domain](../domain/) containers. Currently it only holds the application icon, but sooner or later it will be accompanied by other files like the *privacy statement* and the *terms of use* documents.

This shadow container serves the same goal. It contains all the images used for the documentation.
